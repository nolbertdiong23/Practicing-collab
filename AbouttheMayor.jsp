      <h2>About the Mayor</h2>
      <h5>Profile of the Mayor</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="img2/Yorme.png" class="pictures" style="width:100%"></div>
      <p><strong>Mayor Dean Michael P. Singco</strong></p>
      
      <p>A soft-spoken Mayor from the South, Mayor Dean is the epitome of stolid calmness in times of crises and quiet strength in hurdling challenges. When everyone else is in a state of panic over some tragedy, he stands firm and unafazed. He seldom raises his voice to get things done and believes that getting angry over mistakes and lapses accomplishes nothing but stress. 
	That is the way he is, the kind of leader that Ginatilan has. Born to parents Antonio Ong Singco, former Municipal Mayor of this municipality, and to Justina Pastoriza of Alegria, Cebu, Dean Michael is the fifth child of the couples's six children. During his childhood days, Mayor Dean spent his elementary days at Ginatilan Central School, now Ginatilan Integrated School. 
	<br>
	<br>
	At such a young age, he was already an achiever and graduated Valedictorian of his batch, He then went to Cebu Eastern College for his high school wherein he remained cream of the crop and graduated with honors as fifth honorable mention. He proceeded to the University of San Carlos wherein he took up Bachelor of Science in Electronics Communications Engineering (ECE) and graduated Cum Laude in 1989. 
	In the same year, he took the ECE Board Examination given nationwide and landed Tenth place.
	Having passed the Board exams, he did not rest in his laurels but immediately looked for employment. 
	He was hired by NEC-NTEP at MEPZA, Lapulapu City and was given opportunity to undergo training in Japan. 
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Despite being homesick, he not only loved working abroad but wants to further hone his skills so that he eventually became an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) in several countries such as Hongkong, Macao and Singapore. He developed a strong work ethic which impressed his employers. 
	Years passed and he felt that something in his life is missing. He could no longer deny it, it was in his blood. Mayor Dean came back to Cebu and heeded the call to public service. 
	
	<br>
	<br>
	Following his father, Ete Tony's footsteps, he ran as municipal mayor in 2001 and won. 
	He was reelected twice until his term ended in 2010. 
	Mayor Dean felt the need to continue his service to the Ginatilanons and became Vice-Mayor in 2013. 
	As a leader, Mayor Dean is focused in his goals, dedicated and hardworking. 
	
	<br>
	<br>
	During his administration, barangay roads were opened to constituents even as far as those with difficult terrains such as Barangay Campisong as well as the highest peak in Sitio Bandera in Barangay Salamanca and Sitio Divine Mercy in Barangay Mangaco. 
	Electrification even to far flung sitios. He also gives importance to his advocacy in education believing that quality education is the key to success for the future generations. 
	Three elementary schools particularly Palanas, Mangaco, and Ginatilan Elementary Schools were converted to integrated schools so that free high school education would be nearer to the students in these communities. 
	Mayor Dean also strived for Ginatilan to have its own CTU campus wherein the youth could enjoy free tertiary education.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	His bachelor days came to an end when he finally met the love of his life and tied the knot in May 2014. Mayor Dean is married to Judge Hannah Abella-Singco, who hails from the Abella Clan of Labangon, Cebu City where they have two daughters, Adreanna Honor and Viene Antonete. These days, he strives to achieve the challenging demands of work-life balance. Now on his third term, Mayor Dean is forging ahead and is tirelessly working for a better Ginatilan. 
	Living by his slogan- I love Ginatilan. "Kinasingkasing na serbisyo" and "Abante Ginatilan," this servant leader is determined to pursue several programs for the sustainable development of the community. Always guided by his strong sense of duty to his constituents as well as his unwavering faith in GOD, San Pedro Calungsod and the town's patron saint San Gregorio Magno, he continues the work he has started long ago. 
	In this journey called life, consistently carries himself with integrity and humility and spurns corruptions. 
	 
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 At the end of the day, he can rest well with the knowledge that he did his best for is beloved hometown. 
	 Too, he hopes to leave behind a legacy of commitment and service- for the youth to be imbued with the same sense of purpose and mission to better the lives of the Ginatilanons.
